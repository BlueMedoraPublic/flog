flog is a fake log generator for common log formats such as apache-common, apache error and RFC3164 syslog.

It is useful for testing some tasks which require log data like amazon kinesis log stream test.

## Usage

There are useful options. (`flog --help`)

```console
Options:
  -f, --format string      choose log format. ("apache_common"|"apache_combined"|"apache_error"|"rfc3164"|"rfc5424"|"common_log"|"json") (default "apache_common")
  -o, --output string      output filename. Path-like is allowed. (default "generated.log")
  -t, --type string        log output type. ("stdout"|"log"|"gz") (default "stdout")
  -n, --number integer     number of lines to generate.
  -b, --bytes integer      size of logs to generate (in bytes).
                           "bytes" will be ignored when "number" is set.
  -s, --sleep numeric      fix creation time interval for each log (in seconds). It does not actually sleep.
  -d, --delay numeric      delay log generation speed (in seconds).
  -p, --split-by integer   set the maximum number of lines or maximum size in bytes of a log file.
                           with "number" option, the logs will be split whenever the maximum number of lines is reached.
                           with "byte" option, the logs will be split whenever the maximum size in bytes is reached.
  -w, --overwrite          overwrite the existing log files.
  -l, --loop               loop output forever until killed.
```

```console
# Generate 1000 lines of logs to stdout
flog

# Generate a single log file with 1000 lines of logs, then overwrite existing log file
flog -t log -w

# Generate a single log gzip file with 3000 lines of logs every 10 seconds
flog -t gz -o log.gz -n 3000 -s 10

# Generate logs up to 10MB and split the log files every 1MB in "web/log/apache.log" path with apache combined format
flog -t log -f apache_combined -o web/log/apache.log -b 10485760 -p 1048576

# Generate logs in rfc3164 format infinitely
flog -f rfc3164 -l
```
